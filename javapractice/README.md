# Overview

[Github](https://github.com/QBrokaw/Software/blob/main/javapractice/GuessTheNumber.java)]

{I created a guessing game. The game chooses a random number and the player tries to guess it.}

{This game was created to help me learn Java.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
