# Overview

I created a simple hangman game in Rust.

I created this to help me learn the syntax and mechanics of rust.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- In the future I would like to incorporate randomness to the game.
- Create simple graphics to display your wrong guesses. 
- Add more words to the array.
