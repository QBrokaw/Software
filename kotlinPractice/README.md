# Overview

A very simple NotePad written in Kotlin. It gives you a promt for text, and continues asking for text until the 
user is done.

I wrote this to practice appending to a file and retriving the information from the file.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

Things I would like to fix in the future:

- A UI instead of the terminal.
- Use it to create an Android app
- Create the ablity to reorder notes added in.
